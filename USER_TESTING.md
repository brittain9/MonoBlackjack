All right, I'm going to do another test run here of mono blackjack since our last changes. We have done some updates and...
You know, we did a code review and some updates and the app is looking better. We do have casino mode and practice mode.
Settings and stats so first I want to check my stats really quick and uh I'm going to.
It is pretty cool. So the dealer bust rate by UpGuard. It looks like the dealer busts most when they're showing a 5 or a 10, if I'm reading this correctly. And my outcomes by hand value, I'm not exactly sure what this is showing. I guess maybe it's my win rate. I win 33% of the time, I have 19. And I guess that's what that's showing. And then I have a strategy matrix, which is hard, soft, and pairs. I'm kind of confused what hard, soft, and pairs means here. I think that it does change the card distribution a little bit. So we have gray's low sample. So right now I have low sample, all low sample data. And also my strategy seems to be pretty horrible because I'm mainly losing on most of my cards. But I don't have a ton of data. Yeah, I haven't played that much.
And another thing is it would be cool if I click escape, I would like to take me back. We do have a back button. The back button's at the bottom on this page. Where is it on the settings page? Maybe we want to standardize the back button location. That's not that big of a deal. And then also, like, if I'm in, you know, settings or if I'm in stats, escape. My keybinding, really, it shouldn't necessarily be escape, but whatever my back keybinding. So I'm going to go to practice mode or free play. Is that what it's called? So if I go to, it's called practice mode. I wanted to rename it to free play. That's all right. So I do have now, I have the developer menu here, which is kind of cool. And developer menu, again, it's not respecting my escape close or my back, you know, close button.
We also have this alignment guide, which I don't really know how got added. It's kind of cool, honestly. I don't mind the alignment guide. We can keep it for now. And.
Yeah, so I got...
I got the cue functionality, so I can kind of cue up a split or something here, but I'm just going to play. I'm going to stand here.1.
So i'm gonna go to casino mode and i'm gonna bet a lot of money here so i'm gonna go and i'm gonna go up ace all right so i just queued up a blackjack so i'm just gonna go and stand here so i gotta push i'm now because i get a blackjack i'm gonna deal i lost oh fuck i queued up a blackjack for the dealer all right that's okay when i queue up cards it should be queuing up my cards and the dev um the dev menu i'm not queuing up cards for the dealer um.
Like, if I queued up a split right now, does that mean... Alright, it does queue up a split for me, so I'm going to split here. And this time I got 20 and 21, so I won both ways here. Okay, so if I do place my bet here, I got 9, 8. I'm going to stand. I won. Let me queue up a split hand. Alright, I'm going to... Oh, you got a blackjack. Queue another split hand here.
I'm going to split the fives, okay.
I'm gonna hit stand hit i'm at 15 i'm gonna hit again all right stand here so i won.
All right so i can queue a selected card which is pretty cool so i can queue i'm going to queue a king here so i'm at 11 i hit i get the king pretty cool i win every time all right so that's a cool feature actually i'm now going to do a split i'm going to queue up a bunch of splits here now i'm going to split it and i can split again and okay i get another six here so now i can split again and okay i do have my screen size it looks good right now the rendering of the split looks good definitely an improvement over what it used to be um so yeah it's definitely an improvement over what it used to be.
So now I'm going to queue up. Let me just test out here. I'm at 19. I'm going to queue up a 4. I'll queue up a 5 exactly right here. Now I'm going to hit. Can I get a 5? Nice. I'll stand here. I'm going to hit here. All right, 19. I'll stand there. I'm at 17. I'll just double down here. Or double down work as well. And then I'm going to hit here. All right, so I won three hands. Okay, that was pretty cool. I like how it kind of looked right there. That card sort of folding feature does look pretty cool. In the future, I think it'd be cool if, again, this is like a polishing thing. This is like a future thing. This does not need to be done right now. But it'd be cool if cards can kind of have a little offset to them so they're not perfectly aligned. Kind of look like how you close up cards if you're playing real blackjack. All right, what I'm going to do now is I'm going to...
I haven't really messed with the settings too much. I'm just going to quit the main menu.
Like we do have the key bonds and i can i can change key bonds but what's weird to me right now is there's an arrow to change the key bond which is strange like i'm thinking how the key bond should work is you can type in what key you want or you press the key and it'll set that bond but that could be like a future thing is we that could be a bit to wire up so maybe we don't do that right now you.
Um then assistance yeah we got all that kind of like the state of the game it it does play pretty well i actually do think pretty cool so if i go to my stats right now i see that i made a ton of money not playing that was cheating um but i still think i'm a little bit confused about.
Um, it's a couple of different things here.
Like the stats page needs like a lot of work it looks pretty decent right now but it needs a ton of work um it needs.
Like one thing in this graph i do think the graph view is really cool but i think that in some ways we're just going to have to revisit the stats it's going to need a major major overall but that's going to be in the future and i'm probably gonna have to do that manually because i feel like each of the stats could be a feature in itself you.
