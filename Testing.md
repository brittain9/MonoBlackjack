Im going to play through and All right, so I'm going to play my Mono Blackjack app, and I'm going to test it out. First thing I'm going to do is the screen's opening a little small. That's okay, though, but I'm going to resize it as my monitor is pretty big. And the main menu, I really like the look of it, actually. It's kind of got a nice retro look. I like the Alex's Blackjack. It looks like it was made in VS Paint, or Paint, which I'm pretty sure it was. Just going to kind of go into the settings. The settings look good, but it doesn't look like right now that it really doesn't.
They don't scale very well. I mean, the scaling, it does work, but the size doesn't actually scale. It's pretty much the same exact size fonts. And the button spacing between the two arrows for each choice is a little bit wide, in my opinion. Like something I'm noticing, the three to two blackjack payout, the spacing between the colon and the three could look a little better. These are very minor things. I'm going to kind of just go through and talk about everything. Another thing is I do have bet mode as a setting right now. So bet mode, I think that like in the main menu, we should have like maybe play. Like right now I play settings, stats quit. I could do like casino versus like free play. And free play is going to put you in the mode where there's no betting versus casino is going to have like that full, the full sort of casino blackjack experience. Yeah.
Furthermore, I think it would be helpful to have like setting kind of sections. So like this, the current settings would be maybe like, I don't know, blackjack rules or casino rules. And then maybe another section for like keybinds in the future. These are future things that I think would be cool. But eventually I want you to be able to play blackjack with your keyboard. That's going to be faster. So yeah, keybinds in the future. And then maybe also like maybe even some graphics settings. That would be kind of cool to have like graphics settings. Maybe you can change the font, the background color. I don't know, just some simple stuff like that. That doesn't have to be implemented, but maybe we could plan for it and kind of add those sections.
So now I'm going to click into play here, and I'm currently playing with the bedding. I don't like the bedding UI. I just, I don't like how it sort of looks. But the UI, I think it works for now. So, you know, also, it seems like we added the account of the value, which I don't really like. I think that maybe that could be a setting as well. We do want it configurable. So maybe that could be like, we have another setting section called like, assistance or something for some like, we could even in the future have a recommendation system depending on like, you know, what the dealer up card is and what your cards are. You could have like, we recommend you do this or something like that. So we could have like assistance in the future.
That would be kind of a cool feature, but that's, again, that's, like, future stuff. Right now, what I'm noticing is the rendering of the player's cards are, like, just sort of wrong. They're not aligned with the dealer cards, first of all, and they're overlapping, too. And then the buttons also just look weird. The hit and stand are right next to each other. Then there's a pretty wide gap between stand and double. And I'm going to hit right now. And the 18, that might just be what the 18 looks like.
So I push, or I bet again, I can get insurance here. Okay, so I'm going to get insurance. I lost my insurance.
And I busted as well. So it seems like stuff is working. 16 soft. I'm not sure. It does say 16 soft. Not sure what that's about. 21 soft. Let's stand on that. And we pushed.
I got a blackjack soft.
All right another thing like let's say i want to stop playing blackjack here i can't really do it like i can't press escape to go back to the menu i can't like there's not like a pause menu or something maybe we need a state for a pause menu but i think i did kind of see in the in the code review that are we don't really have a system like we can't like pause the game resume game go like so that potentially may be something because right now there's no way to go back like i guess we could have a back button but i don't want that because i think it would be cool to have like a pause we have the main menu a pause menu so some stuff like that because right now i'm going to close out of the game because that's the only way i can go back to the main menu to see my stats so now i'm going to click stats and uh i think the stats menu is pretty cool here again it doesn't resize very well uh the resizing but these these are probably going to be like pretty big things i'm gonna have to review i'm just kind of.
I want to kind of go into the problems. I'm guessing these things are not something we can one-shot, but rather these are going to be pretty difficult architectural problems for this app. Currently, it's hard for me to read the overview for stats, but it is kind of cool. It shows that I've lost $45. I've played eight rounds in one session. My win rate shows my loss rate, my push rate.
So pretty cool my blackjack rate my bust rate it does show i do like the amount of stats here that is something i want in this game um we also have like dealer up card this doesn't appear to be working very well i mean the stats needs a lot of work but i do i think again that's part of the thing is like you're supposed to be able to play blackjack and sort of analyze your gameplay so that's it's like this is like a fully casino casino blackjack simulation with you know analysis and then maybe in the future we can even do like the recommendation system which wouldn't be very hard but that's again we don't want to only want to fix it up and make and have the architecture extensible so i can add things like that um i wouldn't mind reworking the ui in the future like the place bet i don't like it i also wouldn't mind like having a blackjack table and uh like adding chips adding um like oh yeah something definitely like the dealer peak we need like dealer.
Peak animations, kind of clarity on what's going on in the game. Maybe in the future, this is, again, a future thing, kind of like that recommendation system. We could add other players on the blackjack table and have a configurable amount of players, like other kind of AI players. But they would go really quickly just to kind of simulate what it's like to play at a casino. So that sort of thing. This is kind of my, as I'm playing through right now, that's my analysis of the state of the game currently.
