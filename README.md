# MonoBlackjack

.NET 10 and Mono 3.8.4

When I was first learning programming years ago, I wrote console Blackjack in C++, and then later rewrote in C# after learning the language. I started this project in 2023. My vision now is to turn it into a Retro Style Fully Configurable Casino-Grade Blackjack game with in depth data simulation.

Features:
- Cryptograhic casino-grade shuffling
- Configurable blackjack payouts (3:2, 6:5)
- Configurable shoe size (1 - 1000 decks)
- Cross-platform 
- Retro feel
- Lightweight and highly perfomant
- Clean architecture
- Domain Driven Design
- Event driven architecture
- Unit tests
